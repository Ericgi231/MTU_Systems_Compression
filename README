.zy compression
czy   = 16488 / 11712
czy.c = 3838  / 3678
dzy   = 16600 / 11779
dzy.c = 1962  / 1886

.gz compression
czy   = 16488 / 3218
czy.c = 3838  / 1527
dzy   = 16600 / 3250
dzy.c = 1962  / 829

.gz is the clear winner
Worth noting that .zy compression worked better on the compiled
files than the code files. I imagine this is because our
method works better the more identical bytes there are
close to one another, in the c files this case does not
happen as often.
